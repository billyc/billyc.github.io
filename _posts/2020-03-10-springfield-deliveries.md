In the past 5 years, the number of home deliveries has exploded in Springfield. Delivery vans flood our streets, block bicycle lanes and favour congestion. 

Of course home deliveries are a convenient way to shop and we don t want to miss this service. But we need redefine last mile home deliveries to improve the traffic situation in our city! The city master plan intends to abolish delivery vans from the city center.

Every day thousands of people rely on public transport that connects all parts our beloved city. Why not leverage the existing network to transport parcels as well. We plan to build hubs at the depot and to use cargo trams and buses to distribute the parcels within the city. In every quarter several pick up stations will be installed. These stations enable you to pick up your delivery whenever you want. If your parcel to heavy to pick it up yourself, you can benefit from our cargo bike service. 

In April, we will start a three month field study.  

We will be monitoring the delivery process to ensure a high level of service quality. We believe this pilot study will help our beloved city flourish by decreasing congestion, improving walkability and combating noise pollution.

We look forward to your feedback in the comments or on twitter at #SpringfieldDeliversForYou
